# Introduction

This document presents a comprehensive plan for creating an interactive
web-based historical map that visualizes the changing boundaries of
empires over time. The project aims to integrate cultures, peoples,
religions, battles, political movements, and geographic migrations.
Additionally, we plan to incorporate these data points and relevant
academic papers into a vector database for use with a Large Language
Model (LLM). The integration involves extensive data extraction,
transformation, and loading (ETL) processes from various historical and
geospatial data sources.

# Objectives

-   Create an interactive web-based map displaying the temporal and
    geographical changes of empires.

-   Incorporate sub-regions representing cultures, peoples, and
    religions.

-   Mark significant events such as battles, political movements, and
    migrations.

-   Utilize geocoding and other resources to accurately map historical
    locations.

-   Store data points and related documents in a vector database
    compatible with LLMs.

-   Ensure the map is fast, responsive, and seamlessly integrated into
    the website.

# Recommendations

Based on the considerations above, here are the recommended choices for
the project:

## Database Selection

-   **Use Azure Database for PostgreSQL with PostGIS**

    -   *Rationale*: Provides the necessary geospatial capabilities;
        managed service reduces operational overhead.

    -   *Action*: Modify Terraform scripts to deploy an Azure Database
        for PostgreSQL instance with PostGIS enabled.

## ETL Pipeline Management

-   **Implement Apache Airflow for ETL Pipelines**

    -   *Rationale*: Suitable for complex ETL processes; provides
        scheduling, monitoring, and scalability.

    -   *Action*: Deploy Apache Airflow on Kubernetes using Helm charts
        for easy management.

    -   *Alternative*: If the ETL requirements are simple, start with
        custom Python scripts and cron jobs, and scale up to Airflow
        when necessary.

## Compute Resources

-   **Use Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**

    -   *Rationale*: Facilitates deployment of containerized
        applications; works well with existing tooling (Kubernetes,
        Helm).

    -   *Action*: Use Terraform to provision AKS clusters; deploy
        applications using Helm and Helmfile.

-   **Alternatively, Use Azure App Service**

    -   *Rationale*: Simplifies deployment for smaller applications;
        reduces management overhead.

    -   *Action*: Consider if the application architecture is monolithic
        and doesn't require Kubernetes.

# Next Steps

1.  **Modify Terraform Scripts**

    -   Update scripts to deploy Azure Database for PostgreSQL with
        PostGIS.

    -   Include provisioning of AKS clusters if choosing Kubernetes.

2.  **Set Up ETL Pipelines**

    -   Begin with simple data ingestion scripts.

    -   Set up Apache Airflow for managing ETL processes as complexity
        increases.

3.  **Development Environment**

    -   Use Vagrant with openSUSE Tumbleweed to ensure a consistent
        development environment.

    -   Install necessary tools: Python, Rust, Kubernetes CLI, Helm,
        etc.

4.  **Data Integration**

    -   Start integrating data sources using Python scripts.

    -   Store geospatial data in PostgreSQL with PostGIS.

5.  **Backend Development**

    -   Use Rust to develop high-performance APIs.

    -   Connect the backend to the PostgreSQL database.

6.  **Frontend Development**

    -   Use JavaScript/TypeScript with a framework like React or Vue.js.

    -   Integrate mapping libraries (e.g., Mapbox GL JS) for
        visualization.

7.  **Deploy Applications**

    -   Use Kubernetes with Helm for deployment.

    -   Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

8.  **Monitoring and Maintenance**

    -   Implement monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track
        system performance.

    -   Plan for regular updates and maintenance tasks.

# Conclusion

By carefully selecting the appropriate tooling and cloud resources, we
can build a robust and scalable system for visualizing historical
empires and integrating complex datasets. Using Azure Database for
PostgreSQL with PostGIS enables advanced geospatial capabilities,
essential for this project. Apache Airflow provides a powerful platform
for managing ETL pipelines, ensuring data is up-to-date and accurately
processed. Leveraging existing tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, and
Helm allows for efficient infrastructure management and application
deployment. With these considerations, the project is well-positioned
for success.
